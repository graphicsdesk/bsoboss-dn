  The Columbia Black Students’ Organization and the Barnard Organization of Soul & Solidarity have provided students with community and prioritized political engagement for over five decades. BSO and BOSS provide a space and platform for Black students that the University has historically failed to facilitate, according to leaders within both groups.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In response to protests and student activism in 1968, BSO and BOSS were founded to meet the needs of the Black student bodies of Columbia and Barnard, respectively. Both organizations have grown and evolved over time with shifting political, social, and academic discourse.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>The founding</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The University saw in 1968 mass protests and political organization against the Vietnam War and a planned <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2022/02/15/gym-crow-looking-back-on-the-1968-morningside-gym-protests/">gymnasium</a> in Morningside Park. Some of the students who occupied Hamilton Hall—a pivotal moment during campus unrest—went on to found BSO to politically organize Black students on campus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The purpose of BSO that we especially have tried to express recently and hold on to recently is our political history, our history of organizing around Black causes and anti-oppression causes around the world,” Josiah Keys, CC ’26, vice president of BSO, said. “And ensuring that not only do Black students at Columbia have a positive experience, but also ensuring that our voices, our concerns, and our needs are not only affirmed and recognized but heard and organized around.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  BOSS was founded not only in the context of the 1968 protests at the University, but also in response to Barnard-specific issues. At the time of its founding, Barnard students faced strict housing policies and BOSS organized around the ability for Black students to live together, according to Anique Edwards, BC ’24, a BOSS historian.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While Barnard still <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/03/24/barnards-admissions-policy-necessitates-that-applicants-identify-as-a-woman-what-does-that-mean-in-2022/">grapples</a> with its identity as a women’s college, BOSS has undergone multiple name changes that reflect the college’s own nuanced history with gender. Edwards said that BOSS has changed its name “to affirm the purpose of BOSS: to create an empowering space for Black women, Black nonbinary students, and Black trans students on Barnard’s campus.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  BOSS’s most recent name change occurred in 2020, when the organization transitioned from the Barnard Organization of Soul Sisters to the Barnard Organization of Soul and Solidarity.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Barnard allows Black people who particularly have a different and racialized relationship with gender to have that safe space,” Edwards said. “It’s one of the few Black organizations that is sort of like a gender adjusting organization.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Since their respective foundings, BSO and BOSS have provided a community for all Black students, according to BSO President Anesi Ojior, CC ’25, and BOSS President Maya Darville, BC ’24. Offering more than just a space of political organization, both groups are a site of community that prospective students can look forward to during the admissions process.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Darville said one of her motivations for applying to Barnard was because she knew BOSS and its community existed.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s an incentive to apply, to know that once you apply to this college as a Black student, you’ll be able to join an organization full of other Black people who values things similar to what you value, who care to hear your perspective, who want to have conversations, whether they be fun, light, and airy, or difficult,” Darville said. “Like a space where students can just come and be themselves in whatever unvarnished way.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Malcolm X Lounge, located on the first floor of Hartley Hall, was <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2020/04/21/for-50-years-the-malcolm-x-lounge-has-been-the-epicenter-of-the-student-activism-against-anti-black-violence/">dedicated</a> as a space for Black students to gather on campus in 1970. Today, the lounge remains a space for community and embodies its original intention.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The Malcolm X [Lounge] is kind of crucial,” Nkozi Jones, CC ’24, BSO treasurer, said. “It’s also because it’s one of the few spaces for Black students, that Black students are kind of given some free range to, you know, connect, unwind, etc., etc. Most of our Black orgs meet through this space and it is a space that we kind of also have like the agency over as well.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  BOSS was given the Zora Neale Hurston Lounge as a dedicated space for Black students in 1969. The lounge, located in Reid Hall, has been a place for Black Barnard students to gather for over five decades. The space is named after author Zora Neale Hurston, BC 19’28, the first Black student to graduate from Barnard.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Darville described BOSS as a “safe haven” when she first arrived at Barnard. She said the community BOSS provided in the Zora Neale Hurston Lounge was “indispensable” to her experience on campus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Just to know that this particular person had this type of experience in this institution, and that we get to occupy a space that is named after her, we need to carry on her legacy with the work that we do through this space, it means a lot,” Darville said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ojior emphasized the importance of dedicated campus spaces for Black students.

Prior to this dedication, the University was one of three Ivy League institutions to not have a residential space devoted entirely to Black students.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">

</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Having a Black space on campus is really important because we still, we’re definitely a minority on campus, and so we can be kind of decentralized,” Ojior said. “And so having a Black space on campus dedicated to us is a place where it’s easier to make friends, people who understand your background, and BSO, we represent all, we’re here for all Black students.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  BSO and BOSS have evolved over time, changing with the needs of their communities. Both organizations strive to respond to current events. Keys said BSO aims to “meet the political moment.” Student leaders in both organizations have also made a point to center stronger communities for undergraduates.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  BSO was one of the first student organizations at the University to sign on to the<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2023/11/14/columbia-university-apartheid-divest-who-we-are/"> Columbia University Apartheid Divest coalition.</a> BSO and BOSS released a joint <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2023/11/28/a-statement-of-solidarity-and-a-call-to-action/">statement</a> in November condemning the University’s decision to <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/11/10/columbia-suspends-sjp-and-jvp-following-unauthorized-thursday-walkout/">suspend</a> the Columbia chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If there’s something going on in the world, if there’s a Black issue or a world issue, BSO, because of the Black identity being very political, is always expected to meet that and step up,” Keys said. “And so I think that we’ve historically done a good job of meeting the political moment, creating conversation, creating discourse, and prioritizing the needs of the Black community in that particular moment.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  BOSS co-signed a statement with Mujeres—a Barnard student organization dedicated to the empowerment of Latine identities—declining Barnard President Laura Rosenbury’s invitation to celebrate her inauguration at a student leadership luncheon.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “As organizations that are intrinsically steeped in liberatory tradition and values of diversity, equity, and inclusivity, we find the recent actions of Barnard’s administration to be indefensible and inexcusable,” the letter reads. “As marginalized students within a predominantly white institution, we express profound disappointment in being invited for the perceived benefit of the administration rather than for the collective well-being of the student body.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Darville said releasing a statement against current administrative practices and policies historically aligns with BOSS’s mission, values, and goals.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I would say that, in rejecting the invitation, it’s just in the tradition of BOSS to just speak truth to power and to just call out a wrongdoing,” Darville said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Rosenbury has faced <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/10/31/rosenbury-follow-up-email-on-violence-in-gaza-and-israel-denounces-anti-zionism-draws-criticism-for-biased-rhetoric/">criticism</a> from students and faculty for her response to ongoing campus tensions regarding student activism. At least 19 Barnard students have undergone <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/01/31/the-trust-is-absolutely-broken-barnard-initiates-disciplinary-processes-against-students-after-unauthorized-protest/">disciplinary proceedings</a> by the college for alleged involvement in a Dec. 11 “unauthorized” protest on campus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As the Black student populations at Columbia and Barnard have grown in the past decades, so have BSO and BOSS. Founded out of a need and want to politically organize, both groups recognize their current importance in building community, holding cultural celebrations, and providing a space of inclusivity.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We have a different understanding of our classmates, and our professors, and our administration because of our experiences,” Darville said. “And it’s nice to be in a space where you can have a conversation with your classmate and there’s not necessarily as much of a divide to bridge. So like, I think that BOSS, in more ways than we think, we have more power than we would assume.”
